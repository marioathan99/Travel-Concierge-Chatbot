<task>
Ok, CLINE let's plan building a Streamlit-based chatbot that can recommend travel destinations and activities, leveraging the Claude API for conversational intelligence and an MCP server for external data.

The chatbot should be able to:

Engage in a conversation about travel preferences.
Suggest destinations and activities using synthetic data.
Display recommendations in a clear format.
Utilize an MCP server to look up additional information.
Simulate a "booking" confirmation.

We weren't given any MCP details (like an API endpoint, credentials, or documentation), so we need to mention that on our README.md file to be transparent but we also need to  Simulate MCP Integration in Code. For example, you can create create a function or class that fakes the behavior of MCP e.g., returns dummy or hardcoded data for any “external query.” Add comments saying this is where the real MCP code would go if information were provided.

The technical requirements are as follows. Technical Requirements
Language:
Python 3.9+
UI:
Streamlit
API:
Claude API
Server:
MCP Server

Do not forget to demonstrate at least one call to an MCP tool. (even if it is a mock one)
and create those files: `app.py` where the functional code will lie (you can add more .py documents if needed), `requirements.txt` listing all Python dependencies and a  `README.md` explaining how to run the application.

## Assessment Task: Simplified Travel Concierge Chatbot



**Objective**: Build a Streamlit-based chatbot that can recommend travel destinations and activities, leveraging the Claude API for conversational intelligence and an MCP server for external data.



**Scenario**: You are building a prototype for a personalized travel concierge. The chatbot should be able to:



1. **Engage in a conversation** about travel preferences (e.g., "I want an adventure trip," "Suggest a relaxing beach destination").

2. **Suggest destinations and activities** based on user input. For this prototype, use synthetic data for destinations (e.g., "Dubai", "AlUla") and a few activities for each.

3. **Display recommendations** in a simple, clear format within the chat interface (text-based is sufficient for this assessment, no carousels required).

4. **Utilize an MCP server** (e.g., Perplexity MCP's `search` tool) to simulate looking up additional information about a suggested destination or activity if the user asks for more details (e.g., "Tell me more about AlUla").

5. **Simulate a "booking" confirmation**: When the user expresses interest in a recommendation, the chatbot should confirm the "booking" (no actual booking required, just a confirmation message).



**Technical Requirements:**



* **Python**: Use Python 3.9+.

* **Streamlit**: For the user interface.

* **Claude API**: For natural language understanding and generation. (You will be provided with an API key or a mock service.)

  * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "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"`

  * *Note: This API key is personalized for your assessment, and token usage will be monitored for analytics purposes.*

* **MCP Server**: You will be given access to a pre-configured MCP server (e.g., Perplexity MCP). You must demonstrate its use.



## Instructions



1. **Start in PLAN MODE**: Begin by discussing your approach with Cline. Outline your plan for building the chatbot, including project structure, key components, and how you intend to use Cline and the MCP server.

2. **Switch to ACT MODE**: Once your plan is approved, switch to ACT MODE and begin implementation.

3. **Iterate with Cline**: Work closely with Cline throughout the development process. Ask for code snippets, debugging assistance, and architectural advice.

4. **Demonstrate MCP Usage**: Ensure your chatbot makes at least one call to an MCP tool (e.g., `search` via Perplexity MCP) based on user input.

5. **Deliverables**:

    * A functional Streamlit application (`app.py` and any supporting files).

    * A `requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies.

    * A brief `README.md` explaining how to run the application.

    * The complete chat history of your interaction with Cline during the assessment.



## Time Allotment



You will have **3 days** from the start of the assessment to complete and submit your work. We recommend allocating approximately **4-6 hours** of focused effort within this timeframe for preparation, planning, and implementation.



## Submission Guidelines



Please submit the following deliverables by the deadline:



1. **Your Codebase**: A compressed archive (e.g., `.zip` or `.tar.gz`) of your entire project directory, including `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and any other supporting files.

<response>
Excellent! After reviewing the assessment document, I can see this is a formal evaluation with specific criteria and requirements. This gives me much clearer direction and I need to adjust my plan to align perfectly with the assessment goals.

## Key Changes to My Original Plan

### **1. Assessment-Focused Architecture**
The evaluation emphasizes **collaboration quality (40%)** and **context management (20%)** over pure technical complexity. I need to structure our interaction to demonstrate:
- Clear, concise communication
- Efficient context window usage
- Strategic tool utilization
- Effective Plan/Act mode transitions

### **2. MCP Integration Requirements**
The assessment specifically mentions **Perplexity MCP** with a `search` tool. I need to:
- Demonstrate at least one MCP tool call (as you mentioned)
- Since no actual MCP server details were provided, I'll create a more realistic mock that simulates Perplexity's search functionality
- Structure the code to show exactly where real MCP integration would occur

### **3. Simplified but Effective Scope**
Based on the assessment criteria, I should focus on:
- **Functional prototype** with clean, readable code
- **Effective Streamlit UX** (text-based is sufficient)
- **Synthetic data** for destinations (Dubai, AlUla as mentioned)
- **Booking simulation** (simple confirmation)

## Revised Implementation Plan

### **Core Architecture (Simplified)**

    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#ffebee
```

### **File Structure (Streamlined)**
- **`app.py`** - Main Streamlit application (primary focus)
- **`travel_data.py`** - Synthetic destinations and activities
- **`mock_mcp.py`** - Perplexity MCP simulation with search tool
- **`requirements.txt`** - Dependencies
- **`README.md`** - Setup instructions with MCP transparency

### **Key Implementation Focus Areas**

**1. Streamlit Chat Interface:**
- Clean, intuitive chat UI using `st.chat_message` and `st.chat_input`
- Session state management for conversation history
- Clear display of recommendations and booking confirmations

**2. Claude API Integration:**
- Using provided API key: `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`
- Structured prompts for travel recommendations
- Context-aware conversation flow

**3. Mock MCP Integration:**
- Realistic simulation of Perplexity search tool
- Clear documentation of where real MCP would integrate
- Demonstration of tool call when user asks for "more details"

**4. Travel Data & Logic:**
- Synthetic data for Dubai, AlUla, and other destinations
- Activity recommendations per destination
- Simple booking confirmation system

### **Assessment Criteria Alignment**

**Cline Collaboration (40%):** I'll ensure our interaction demonstrates:
- Clear, specific requests
- Efficient problem breakdown
- Effective iteration and debugging
- Good understanding of capabilities

**Context Management (20%):** I'll:
- Use targeted file operations
- Provide concise, relevant information
- Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth

**Plan vs Act Mode (20%):** 
- Strategic planning here in PLAN MODE
- Clear transition rationale to ACT MODE
- Effective execution in ACT MODE

**MCP Integration (10%):**
- Mock Perplexity search tool demonstration
- Clear integration points documentation

**Prototype Quality (10%):**
- Clean, functional code
- Good UX design
- Proper error handling

## Questions Before Implementation

1. Should I proceed with this revised, assessment-focused plan?
2. Are you ready for me to demonstrate the Plan → Act mode transition by asking you to "toggle to Act mode"?
3. Any specific destinations or activities you'd like me to include beyond Dubai and AlUla?

This approach should score well across all evaluation criteria while delivering a functional, impressive prototype.

**User:**

[plan_mode_respond] Result:
<user_message>
This is an excellent plan! Your architecture diagram shows you understand the requirements well! However, I have some suggestions to make: 

 For the Mock MCP, consider simulating realistic search results like:

Weather data ("Dubai: 35°C, sunny")
Travel advisories ("No restrictions")
Local events ("Dubai Shopping Festival in January")

For Synthetic Travel Data, include diverse options:

Adventure: Dubai (desert safaris), AlUla (rock climbing)
Culture: Kyoto (temples), Rome (history)
Beach: Maldives, Bali
City: Singapore, Barcelona

In our README.md, explain why we mocked MCP, as this shows maturity and communication skills.

## MCP Integration Notes

### Why We Used Mock MCP Integration

This prototype demonstrates MCP integration patterns without requiring actual MCP server configuration. In a production environment, you would:

1. **Configure Real MCP Server**: Connect to actual Perplexity MCP or similar service
2. **Handle Authentication**: Manage API keys and authentication tokens
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for external API calls
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement backoff strategies

### Mock Implementation Benefits

- **Demonstrates Integration Patterns**: Shows exactly where MCP calls would occur
- **Reliable Testing**: Consistent responses for development and demonstration
- **Clear Documentation**: Makes integration points obvious for future development
```

### **Final Architecture with Your Enhancements**

```

### **Implementation Sequence**
1. **Core Streamlit app** with chat interface
2. **Claude API integration** with conversation management
3. **Synthetic travel data** with your suggested destinations
4. **Mock MCP integration** with realistic search responses
5. **Booking confirmation** system
6. **Professional README** with MCP explanation

This enhanced approach will demonstrate:
- **Technical competence** through realistic data simulation
- **Communication skills** through clear MCP documentation
- **Strategic thinking** by showing production considerations
- **Attention to detail** with diverse, well-structured travel options

## 🔧 MCP Integration

### Current Implementation (Mock)

This prototype demonstrates MCP integration patterns using simulated data. The mock implementation provides:

- **Weather Data**: Current conditions for all destinations
- **Travel Advisories**: Safety and restriction information
- **Local Events**: Festivals, cultural events, and seasonal activities

### Why We Used Mock MCP Integration

**Development Benefits:**
- **Demonstrates Integration Patterns**: Shows exactly where MCP calls would occur in production
- **Reliable Testing**: Consistent responses for development and demonstration
- **Clear Documentation**: Makes integration points obvious for future development
- **Assessment Compliance**: Meets requirements without requiring actual MCP server setup

### Production Implementation

In a production environment, you would:

1. **Configure Real MCP Server**
   ```python
   # Replace mock_mcp.py with actual MCP client
   from mcp_client import MCPClient
   client = MCPClient("perplexity-mcp")
   result = client.use_tool("search", {"query": query})
   ```

2. **Handle Authentication**
   - Manage API keys and authentication tokens
   - Implement secure credential storage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Robust error handling for external API calls
   - Fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Respect API rate limits
   - Implement exponential backoff strategies

### MCP Integration Points in Code

Look for these comments in the codebase:
```python
# This is where real MCP integration would occur
# In production, replace this with actual MCP client calls
```

Ok, so let's start reviewing our code and debugging it a bit. You have done an excellent job, but keep in mind that we have two objectives that we cannot compromise: 1. An excellent UI (which you have done with those emojis, comments and well documented code) the UX which is not yet perfected since we have encountered some errors and 2. All assignments goals need to be achieved with the best possible outcomes. These two factors cannot be compromised even with the mock mcp.

I sense that due to the fact that Shell Integration was Unavailable you had a limited view as per the errors during the command runs thus I will list them here:

   ```python
   # Replace mock_mcp.py with actual MCP client
   from mcp_client import MCPClient
   client = MCPClient("perplexity-mcp")
   result = client.use_tool("search", {"query": query})
   ```

2. **Handle Authentication**
   - Manage API keys and authentication tokens
   - Implement secure credential storage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Robust error handling for external API calls
   - Fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Respect API rate limits
   - Implement exponential backoff strategies

### MCP Integration Points in Code

Look for these comments in the codebase:
```python
# This is where real MCP integration would occur
# In production, replace this with actual MCP client calls
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Dependencies
