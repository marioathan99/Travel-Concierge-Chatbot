## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Python Installation (Windows)

If you don't have Python installed:

1. **Download Python from official website**
   - Visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download Python 3.9+ for Windows
   - **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python --version
   # or try:
   py --version
   ```

3. **Verify pip is available**
   ```bash
   pip --version
   # or try:
   py -m pip --version
   ```

### Installation

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. **Download all project files to a folder**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you have these files in your project directory:
   # - app.py
   # - travel_data.py
   # - mock_mcp.py
   # - requirements.txt
   # - README.md
   # - setup.py
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   # Try one of these commands:
   python setup.py
   # or:
   py setup.py
   ```
   
   The setup script will:
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Verify all files are present
   - Install dependencies automatically
   - Test imports
   - Launch the application

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Try one of these commands:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or if pip doesn't work:
   py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or if python is available:
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Try one of these commands:
   streamlit run app.py
   # or if streamlit isn't in PATH:
   py -m streamlit run app.py
   # or:
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to the URL shown in your terminal

### Troubleshooting

**If Python is not found:**
- Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" option checked
- Restart your terminal/command prompt
- Try using `py` instead of `python`

**If imports fail:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try using virtual environment (see Advanced Setup below)

**If Streamlit doesn't start:**
- Check if port 8501 is available
- Try: `py -m streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

## üéØ How to Use

### Getting Started
1. **Set Your Preferences**: Use the sidebar to specify budget, travel style, group size, and dates
2. **Start Chatting**: Ask about destinations, activities, or travel advice
3. **Get Recommendations**: Receive personalized destination and activity suggestions
4. **Request Details**: Ask for "more details" to trigger MCP search for current information
5. **Book Your Trip**: Express interest to simulate the booking process

### Example Conversations

**Adventure Seeker:**
```
User: "I want an adventure trip with rock climbing"
Bot: Recommends AlUla with detailed rock climbing activities and pricing
```

**Beach Lover:**
```
User: "Suggest a relaxing beach destination"
Bot: Presents Maldives, Bali, or Santorini with beach activities
```

**Current Information:**
```
User: "What's the weather like in Dubai?"
Bot: Triggers MCP search and provides current weather data
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **`app.py`**: Main Streamlit application with chat interface
- **`travel_data.py`**: Comprehensive synthetic travel database
- **`mock_mcp.py`**: MCP integration simulation with realistic data

### Data Structure

**Destinations by Category:**
- **Adventure**: Dubai, AlUla, New Zealand
- **Culture**: Kyoto, Rome, Istanbul  
- **Beach**: Maldives, Bali, Santorini
- **City**: Singapore, Barcelona, Tokyo

Each destination includes:
- Detailed descriptions
- 4+ activities with pricing and ratings
- Best travel times
- Budget ranges
- Climate information

## üîß MCP Integration

### Current Implementation (Mock)

This prototype demonstrates MCP integration patterns using simulated data. The mock implementation provides:

- **Weather Data**: Current conditions for all destinations
- **Travel Advisories**: Safety and restriction information
- **Local Events**: Festivals, cultural events, and seasonal activities

### Why We Used Mock MCP Integration

**Development Benefits:**
- **Demonstrates Integration Patterns**: Shows exactly where MCP calls would occur in production
- **Reliable Testing**: Consistent responses for development and demonstration
- **Clear Documentation**: Makes integration points obvious for future development
- **Assessment Compliance**: Meets requirements without requiring actual MCP server setup

### Production Implementation

In a production environment, you would:

1. **Configure Real MCP Server**
   ```python
   # Replace mock_mcp.py with actual MCP client
   from mcp_client import MCPClient
   client = MCPClient("perplexity-mcp")
   result = client.use_tool("search", {"query": query})
   ```

2. **Handle Authentication**
   - Manage API keys and authentication tokens
   - Implement secure credential storage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Robust error handling for external API calls
   - Fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Respect API rate limits
   - Implement exponential backoff strategies

### MCP Integration Points in Code

Look for these comments in the codebase:
```python
# This is where real MCP integration would occur
# In production, replace this with actual MCP client calls
```
